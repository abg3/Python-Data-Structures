Next, we have a while loop on line 5 which runs as long as i is less than j. i is supposed to go forward from the beginning of s while j has to go backward from the end of s. So, on line 6 and on line 8, we have two while loops which increment or decrement the iterators accordingly. So i is incremented on line 7 if s[i] is not an alphanumeric and i is less than j. Similarly, j is decremented on line 9 if s[j] is not alphanumeric and i is less than j. This will help us ignore all the characters in s which are not alphanumeric.\n",

However, if s[i] and s[j] do not match, False is returned from the function on line 12 to indicate an instance where the character pointed to by i is not the same as the character pointed to by j. If s[i] equals s[j], the execution proceeds to lines 13-14 where i is incremented and j is decremented to move to the next characters. If the condition on line 11 stays False for all possible iterations of the while loop, True is returned on line 15 to indicate that s is indeed a palindrome."
